    <h1> Mercury </h1>
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p> Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. <br>
    In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years.
