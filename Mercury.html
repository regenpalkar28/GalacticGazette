    <h1> Mercury </h1>
    
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p>
        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. <br>
        Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. <br> <br>
        It orbits the Sun once every 88 Earth days, making it the fastest planet in terms of orbital speed—hence its name after Mercury, the swift-footed Roman messenger god. Despite being the closest to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet (that title belongs to Venus) due to its lack of a substantial atmosphere to trap heat. It has no moons and completes a slow rotation every 59 Earth days, leading to extremely long days and nights. With a diameter of about 4,879 kilometers, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth’s Moon and shares a similarly cratered, rocky appearance. The planet has fascinated astronomers for centuries due to its rapid movement in the sky and extreme surface conditions, which have been gradually revealed by space missions in recent decades.

    <h2> Physical Characteristics </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface Temperature:</strong> Day: Up to 430°C (800°F), Night: Down to -180°C (-290°F)</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Features:</strong> Heavily cratered, large impact basins (e.g., Caloris Basin), cliffs and scarps due to shrinking, volcanic plains</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> Approximately 38% of Earth’s gravity</li>
        <li><strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> Present, about 1% the strength of Earth’s, generated by a partially molten core</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Chemical Composition </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Core:</strong> Very large, about 85% of the planet’s radius, composed mostly of iron and nickel</li>
        <li><strong>Mantle and Crust:</strong> Silicate materials</li>
        <li><strong>Exosphere:</strong> Extremely thin atmosphere made of oxygen (O₂), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H₂), helium (He), and potassium (K); particles escape easily into space</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Space Expeditions </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mariner 10 (1974–1975):</strong> First spacecraft to visit Mercury; flew by three times and captured the first close-up images of the surface; discovered Mercury’s magnetic field.</li>
        <li><strong>MESSENGER (2011–2015):</strong> First to orbit Mercury; mapped the entire surface and discovered water ice, volcanic activity, and high sulfur content.</li>
        <li><strong>BepiColombo (Launched 2018, arriving in 2025):</strong> A joint ESA-JAXA mission; includes two orbiters to study Mercury’s magnetic field, surface, and composition.</li>
    </ul>
