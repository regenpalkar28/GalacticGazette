  <h1>Uranus</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest by diameter. It is known for its unique sideways rotation—its axis is tilted over 90 degrees, making it roll around the Sun like a barrel. Uranus is an ice giant, with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a pale blue-green color.
